jwalk - JSON Walker
===================

Print matching values from a JSON input for a given path expression.

Jwalk extracts JSON values (literals, strings and array values) from standard input or a named file, matching a given expression. Matched values are printed to standard output concatenated by a character delimiter, using new line by default.


Usage
-----

    jwalk [--delimiter <char>] [--file <file_name>] <expression>

Examples:
    jwalk "*.name" < file.json
    gzcat big.json.gz | jwalk "*.name"

Options:
    -d <char>, --delimiter <char>
     The <char> delimiter that separates matched values; e.g.: -d $'\t'
    -f <file_name>, --file <file_name>
     The name of a file containing JSON text
    <expression>
     A path to traverse the JSON tree; e.g.: house.room.name

Notes:
    'stdin' is the default input stream

Expressions
-----------

Jwalk supports simple expressions with partial globbing to extract data from a JSON structure.

An expression specifies a path through a JSON object hierarchy. The path is composed by the name of each JSON property to traverse. To specify a path, each property along the route from the root object to the property that holds the target value must be included in the path, with each property in the sequence being separated by a dot.

Side note, there is no aim to support JSON-Path nor XPath syntax. The idea is to keep extraction straightforward, as simple as possible, aligned with an evolving set of use cases.


Building from source
--------------------

Autotools are used to ease the building process.

1) Clone jwalk git repository.
2) Run autogen.sh
3) Generate make files suited for your system:
     ./configure
4) Compile:
     make
5) Install jwalk:
     sudo make install

That's all.

TODO
----

* Add support for selection of multiple paths and its output concatenation.
    Example of use: flatten JSON properties with arbitrary nesting to a CSV representation.
* Expand globbing support for arbitrary tree levels with double asterisk symbol.
* Improve this README.
* Add man page.
* Provide pre-built packages.
